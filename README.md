# Software tools
This project was made using Eclipse, SceneBuilder, MySql server 8, and MySql Workbench 8.  

# After cloning project
1. Run script called 'Tables-WebMart.sql' to create the database with tables and a default user. 
2. Run Main.java. It should show the login page. Click on the button that says 'Database Setup' to make sure that your database information is correct. If you decide to use a different database username or password instead of the default user given in the script, you can enter it in and save it on this page.
3. Test connection. If it is successful you can go to login page to create a new account and start using WebMart.
4. After setting up database connection, you can fill up the inventory table with some sample data by running InitializeInventory.java in the WebMart package. With this you can add items to the shopping cart by clicking on a row in the inventory table view and pressing 'Add to Cart' under the Shopping Cart menu.
